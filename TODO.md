TODOS
============

* [`PageWeb\Support\Facebook\DummyGraphClient::getPageAlbums()`] Implement parsing facebook multi-query for option 'connection_photos'
* [Module:Editor] Improve support for firefox


* Implement displaying success or failure message for each site action. Currently there is no way to show a success or error message and it affects the user experience (.........In Progress)
* Should be able to post message to users Facebook timeline after they have published their website. Content of the message will be  for example "Stanley has created a new website "Website Name" using Pageweb.co. The should include links to the website and pageweb with a screenshot of the theme the use as the image.
* Include a default contact us form or better still start thinking how we would implement add-ons
* Start working on developers documentation for creating themes


* Implement sending emails to users after registering through Facebook [Done...]
* Get started with creating add-ons
* Create between 10 -15 themes by end of April
* Implement custom site statistics or integrate google analytics
* Implement calling Facebook comments or disqus comments on pages
* Implement ability to create custom pages 
* Adding custom pages to menu items 
* Private Themes - The idea here is to enable developers create themes which is only usable by them. For example, I might have a client who want something custom and I want to use Pageweb, I can create the theme upload it to pageweb and use it just for that client. That theme is not available to the general public.
