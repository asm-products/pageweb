                                The reason is simple – to increase your online exposure. There is a whole world outside of Facebook that you simply miss out on if you do not have your own website. Once you have your own site – more people are exposed to your information (customers, friends and family, etc.) More than that - Google is not scanning the facebook pages and that’s why your business data will not come up in google search while an independent site will allow google to show your business.
